There are several possible reasons why you don't have SSH access to your server.
1.Let's start with checking if ssh installed. You can check it with command -> "which sshd"
  If the server is installed you will get a path otherwise you will get an error and you will
  need to install both the SSH Client and the SSH server.
  For example( on Ubuntu ) you can enter following command : 
    sudo apt-install openssh-server openssh-clients
2.You should make sure that ssh sever is running with command:
    sudo ps -ax | grep sshd
  if it's not running you can start it by: sudo service ssh start
  if it is running you can restart it by:  sudo service ssh restart   
3.Make sure that the system is waiting for connections on port 22:
  Port 22 is the default port for SSH connections.
    sudo netstat -apn | grep sshd 
  by entring this command you will see which port SSH is listening to. 
  if SSH is listening to a port other than port 22, you will need to change your connection settings.
4.Or you can examine your firewall rules.
  If your your firewall rules blocked traffic to port 22 you can allow it by : sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
  or you can add any other TCP port number (instead of 22) that you are using to run SSH.
